# ioLayout
A small CSS-JS framework for everyone

ioLayout is a simple layout model written in <strong>CSS3,JAVASCRIPT,HTML5.</strong>
It relies on mobile-first-approach as well as freedom from other libraries
like JQuery and other CSS frameworks.<br>
It comes with a blue color refining, but you can easily change it by following
"blue.css" file.
<br><br>
ioLayout includes some files hand-written in pure javascript (no JQuery, for real)
to manage its main features like:
<ul>
  <li>Responsive and sticky navigation bar</li>
  <li>Smart forms with input recognition</li>
  <li>Some hand-written library functions that make me possible excluding JQuery from the project</li>
</ul>

ioLayout provides a main css file, <strong>'ioLayout.css'</strong> that provides the main functionalities, another file <strong>'responsive.css'</strong>,
adapts ioLayout to every screen with some CSS Media Rules.
Moreover it comes with a default color file <strong>'blue.css'</strong> that can be altered to match other color-palettes.
I recommend to follow Google Material Design color guidelines to achieve a perfect interaction between colors.
<br><br>
At the moment ioLayout is being developed only by me, and it will be updated soon. I will include more functionalities<br>
as soon as I figure out them.<br>
I have added a new file called 'examples.html' in which you will find code-explained examples of ioLayout's elements implementation.
